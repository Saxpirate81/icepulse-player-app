2. **Video Verification**: AI tracks actual performance
3. **Automatic Adjustment**: System adapts based on completion rate
4. **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increases as player improves

### Performance-Based Adjustments

#### If Player Completes All Reps Easily (100%+)
- **Action**: Progress
- **Suggestions**:
  - Increase reps by 2-3
  - Add weight/resistance
  - Try advanced variation
- **Automatic**: Next workout increases difficulty

#### If Player Completes 80-99% of Reps
- **Action**: Maintain
- **Suggestions**:
  - Continue with current reps
  - Focus on perfect form
  - Rest properly between sets
- **Automatic**: Stay at current level

#### If Player Completes 50-79% of Reps
- **Action**: Reduce
- **Suggestions**:
  - Reduce reps to build gradually
  - Use assisted variation
  - Focus on form over quantity
- **Automatic**: Next workout decreases reps

#### If Player Completes <50% of Reps
- **Action**: Modify
- **Suggestions**:
  - Try beginner variation
  - Reduce reps significantly
  - Use lighter/no weight
  - Build foundational strength first
- **Automatic**: Switches to easier variation

## 📊 Video-Verified Rep Counting

### AI-Powered Rep Detection
- **Push-Ups**: Tracks down/up motion
- **Squats**: Detects knee bend depth
- **Pull-Ups**: Monitors chin-over-bar position
- **Other Exercises**: Generic movement tracking

### Verification Process
1. **Real-Time Counting**: Reps counted as player performs exercise
2. **Form Check**: Ensures proper range of motion
3. **Rep Validation**: Only counts complete, proper reps
4. **Confidence Score**: Shows accuracy of count

### Anti-Cheat Measures
- **Video Required**: All exercises must be video verified
- **Form Validation**: Reps only count with proper form
- **Continuous Recording**: Can't skip or fast-forward
- **Pose Tracking**: AI verifies actual movement
